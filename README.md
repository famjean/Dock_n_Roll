## Overview 
This project contains scripts and indication to create and run a docker container image with a graphical user interface (GUI) with R, Rstudio, Git and Latex. It allows to fix versions of programs and use it in a graphical mode.  

For the R packages stability we can use in addition of the checkpoint package (Microsoft Corporation (2018). checkpoint: Install Packages from Snapshots on the Checkpoint Server for Reproducibility. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=checkpoint) to fix packages to specific dates. Hence your analysis will be perfectly replicable. 

Git and Latex are provided to permit use of Rmarkdown to create reports.
